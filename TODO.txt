TODO:
- Debug individual.py -> _distribution_mean() function to make sure it does what we think it does: Thomas
- Honeycomb warm start: Thomas
- Mutating force strength just like we do the variances: Sid
- Add inertia to force: Alex
- Optimizing the hyperparameters: Sid
- "Change the constraint handling technique by implementing either boundary repair [1] or the more advanced
constraint domination [5]" -> check this means the boundary clipping: Alex



Sid:
Mutate force strengths, parameters and genotypes all with different mutation_rates - maybe dynamically change the mutation rates
Optimise the hyperparameters
